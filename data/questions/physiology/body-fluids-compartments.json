Could be 307 if glucose 100? Let's adjust: maybe BUN 12? We'll accept A as closest. However, typical formula: 2*Na + glucose/18 + BUN/2.8. 2*150=300, glucose/18=5, BUN/2.8=5, total=310. But options don't have 310. Possibly they use different units. We'll keep as 310, but in options, maybe 307 if Na 148? We'll just pick 307 as nearest. To avoid confusion, we can make values that yield exact 300: Na 145, glucose 90, BUN 14 → 290+5+5=300. Let's change numbers: If Na=145, glucose=90, BUN=14 → 2*145=290, glucose/18=5, BUN/2.8=5, total=300. So we'll set the question with Na=145.
