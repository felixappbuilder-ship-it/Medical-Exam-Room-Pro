      "options": [
        "A. Sagittal plane",
        "B. Coronal plane",
        "C. Transverse plane",
        "D. Oblique plane"
      ],
      "correct": "D",
      "explanation": "The oblique plane is not a standard anatomical plane. The standard planes are sagittal (divides left-right), coronal/frontal (divides anterior-posterior), and transverse/horizontal (divides superior-inferior).",

      "correct": "B",
